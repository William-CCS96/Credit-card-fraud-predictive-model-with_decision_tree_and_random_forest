    "The Data set [\"Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)\"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) of kaggel contains Predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant. Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.\n",
